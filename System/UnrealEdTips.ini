[Tips]
TotalTips=44
Tip0=You can add brushes with CTRL+A and subtract them with CTRL+S
Tip1=If you right click the Add Mover button on the left, you can select from a menu of mover types
Tip2=If you right click the Add Volume button on the left, you can select from a menu of volume types
Tip3=If you right click the toolbar at the top of a viewport, a menu will appear allowing you to control the appearance of that viewport
Tip4=You can toggle the visibility of static meshes with the "W" key
Tip5=You can toggle the visibility of actors with the "H" key
Tip6=You can toggle the visibility of the builder brush with the "B" key
Tip7=You can toggle the visibility of fog with the "F" key (doesn't apply to fog caused by a volume)
Tip8=You can toggle the visibility of the skybox with the "K" key
Tip9=You can toggle the visibility of volumes with the "O" key
Tip10=You can toggle the visibility of terrain with the "T" key
Tip11=You can toggle the visibility of your current selection highlight with the "S" key
Tip12=You can toggle the visibility of all static meshes with the "W" key
Tip13=You can toggle the visibility of an actor's collider by switching to the Radii view found by right clicking a viewport and going to Actors --> Radii view
Tip14=You can switch between the render modes while looking through the perspective viewport by holding Alt and then hitting any key between 0-9
Tip15=When selecting a static mesh or trigger that doesn't have bCollideActors set to true, set it to true to prevent a crash by building all
Tip16=To return a few missing mechanics back to the Shrek 2 maps, make sure to utilize the MPak library modification
Tip17=You can make your own prefabs by selecting a group of actors (volumes/brushes don't work properly without crashes), then opening the Prefab window and clicking Create Prefab from Selected Actors
Tip18=It's recommended to open up all the sound files, as well as static meshes before doing any map work
Tip19=Don't manually open AmbCreatureAnims.ukx in /Animations because it will cause an editor crash and will cause you to lose progress. The editor already opens this file by default
Tip20=Save as often as you can, as well as making backups. Maps can get corrupted if you're unlucky, so be smart
Tip21=Autosaves are created every 5 minutes in the /maps directory found inside the editor. If your map gets corrupted, you should check your latest auto saves seen in your editor's maps folder
Tip22=Making any attempt to open the original sound files will result in a crash; only use the patched variants instead
Tip23=Re-opening the same or similar map will eventually cause the editor to crash
Tip24=Use the right click menu to quickly place down common actors to speed up your progress
Tip25=It's recommended to use the provided developer map to quickly test something
Tip26=Remember to utilize groups in situations where there are too many actors near each other or when your map starts to get big or complex
Tip27=Keeping brushes on a grid vector that is divisible by 2 on all 3 axes makes it easier for the engine to render them, and therefore, improves performance
Tip28=Shrek must be in every level in order for it to work properly
Tip29=Always use KW variants of actors when available, except the KWLight (the KWLight is simply a dynamic light)
Tip30=Use the in-game debug tools in order to get your map to work even better than before, such as improving the optimization and figuring out all the ins and outs of your map
Tip31=Always use a KWTrigger over a Trigger, since this allows for box triggers and a lot of other features exclusive to it
Tip32=It's heavily recommended to draft your map idea out before applying it inside the editor
Tip33=If you add in a ladder volume into your map, it will automatically add in AutoLadder's into the map upon building all. These get replaced each time with each build, but do NOT get deleted. This will cause the file size of your map to keep going up with each build. You can hack these out by changing the reference to AutoLadder to "0000000000" through a hex editor, then opening the hacked map and building all
Tip34=The bigger the map size, the longer the saves and loads take while playing the map. Always make sure the least amount of data is inside your map in order to make saves and loads quick and fast (general tip: don't put textures and whatnot inside myLevel)
Tip35=Pressing Shift+D with a selected actor will duplicate all selected actors
Tip36=You can select a class through text by typing in the console seen in the bottom left, "SetCurrentClass Class=Shrek" (replace Shrek with any actor in the game). Doing this allows you to quickly select which actors you wish to place down, provided you memorize the exact names of them
Tip37=Hold CTRL+ALT+LMB will allow you to make a 2D box selection, which allows you to quickly select a group of actors
Tip38=Some variables seen in the editor do not do anything at all. You can thank KnowWonder for this
Tip39=Some variables have empty values inside of an array. This is thanks to the editor not working 100% as intended. The default values do technically get assigned as far as the game is concerned, and the editor can still modify these
Tip40=Emitters made by KnowWonder have custom-set opacity values which cannot be accessed, but if you use the MPak library modification, you can use MPatcher to fix this (or MEmitter to manually assign your own opacity values)
Tip41=Have you tried the mod, "Master Pack (MPak)?" MPak is a complex, yet intuitive and fully-documented library of code that provides a lot of convenient features for modders
Tip42=Have you tried the mod, "Community Brush Builder Pack (CBBP)?" It gives you access to 11 new brush builders that can used inside the level editor, giving you a lot of power in terms of building
Tip43=Pressing Shift+B while having a selected surface will select all surfaces related to the current brush selected
