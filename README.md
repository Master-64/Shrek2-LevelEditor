# Shrek 2 (PC) Level Editor
A collection of mods and patches on top of UE2 Runtime, allowing for the creation of maps and compiling code.
This repository is a standalone level editor, meaning no patching is required to run it.

Documentation on using the level editor is available on the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shrek-2-pc-wiki/modding-tutorials/getting-started">Shrek 2 Wiki</a>, however, it's a massive work-in-progress.
